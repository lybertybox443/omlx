"""Grammar-constrained decoding via xgrammar.

Provides a logits processor that enforces grammar constraints by masking
invalid tokens at sampling time.  Follows the same ``__call__(tokens, logits)``
interface used by :class:`ThinkingBudgetProcessor`.

Phase-awareness (thinking vs. output) is handled by the *grammar itself*
via xgrammar's structural tag API, not by this processor.  For thinking
models the grammar is compiled as a ``sequence`` of
``[tag(<think>, any_text, </think>), constrained_schema]`` so that the
bitmask is permissive during reasoning and constrained during output.
This keeps the processor simple and enables uniform batched bitmask
computation (parallel model forward || bitmask fill).

The processor has two ways of learning which token was sampled from its
bitmask:

1. **Deferred** (default, the BatchGenerator path): ``__call__`` only fills
   and applies the bitmask and marks the row :attr:`pending`; the scheduler's
   monkey-patched ``GenerationBatch._step`` calls :meth:`accept_token` with
   the sampled id at the top of the following step, where the id has to be
   evaluated anyway.  Advancing the matcher from ``tokens`` here would force a
   host sync per step, which is what constrained decoding's throughput was
   lost to before the accept moved (#2561).

2. **Speculative** (the MTP verify walks, entered via
   :meth:`begin_speculative`): the caller hands ``__call__`` the concrete
   history the logits are conditioned on (the committed prefix plus the draft
   tokens before this position) and the processor advances the matcher to
   that history itself, accepting new tokens and rolling back when the
   history is shorter than the last one it saw.  :meth:`snapshot_state` /
   :meth:`restore_state` checkpoint the matcher position so a rejected draft
   suffix can be undone with ``GrammarMatcher.rollback``.  The row is never
   marked pending in this mode; :meth:`end_speculative` hands the request
   back to the deferred protocol with a consistent matcher.

A third, unused batched mode (``advance`` + ``BatchGrammarMatcher``) is kept
for compatibility.
